## Description: 

So you've learnt some Java, but are struggling to get an interview, 
let alone a job. Or you are stuck in a low paying programming job, and want to 
move up to a better, more senior position. Maybe you have never programmed 
before, and are looking for a way to get into programming for the first time. 
But, just how do you get employers to notice you? How do you make your resume 
stand out of the crowd of programmers looking for work? By becoming certified as 
an Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) Java 8 Programmer! 

Being certified moves your name to the top of the list for job interviews, 
because there are so few other programmers officially certified by Oracle. The 
Oracle Certified Associate exam (required to claim Oracle Certification) can be 
difficult to pass, even for experienced Java developers. This course makes 
passing the exam easy! This course will teach you everything you need to know, 
to be able to successfully get certified as an Oracle Certified Associate Java 8 
Programmer and pass the exam. Your instructor, Goran Lochert, is himself Java 
Certified, and an expert Java developer, with many years of programming 
experience. Goran knows first hand what is required to pass the exam, because he 
has done it himself. He will take you step by step, going through each and every 
topic you need to master, to be able to pass the exam and receive your official 
Oracle certification. It's a fact that you remember about 80% of what you do, 
and only 30% of what you see, so this is a hands-on course. It's not just 
theory, like many other certification courses. Rather, it's hands-on, and 
designed for you to follow along, in code. The more you work with the code shown 
in the course, the sooner you will be able to pass the exam and receive Oracle 
certification. If you have taken the OCA exam before and failed, then this 
course is especially relevant to you. 

In addition to the over 19 hours of videos, there is also practice exams that 
you can take to test your skills and readiness to pass the exam. If you are 
ready to get that first paid programming job, or to move up to a more senior 
programming position, then this course is for you! After completing this course, 
you will have the necessary skills to pass the exam, including the tricky, and 
difficult questions that can trip up even experienced Java developers. An 
example of some of the tricky questions fully explained in the course include 
polymorphic parameters, immutability, predicates, differences between abstract 
classes and interfaces with default methods, and so on. The sooner you sign up 
for this course, the sooner you will have the skills and knowledge you need to 
be able to pass the exam and become Oracle Certified. Your new job awaits! Why
